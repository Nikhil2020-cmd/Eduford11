    <p id="font"> Object detection is a computer technology related to 
        computer vision and image processing that deals with
        detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain
        class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital
        images and videos.[1] Well-researched domains of object
        detection include face detection and pedestrian detection.
        Object detection has applications in many areas of computer
         vision, including image retrieval and video surveillance.</p>
